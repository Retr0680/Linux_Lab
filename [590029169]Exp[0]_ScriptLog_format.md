## Experiment [X]: [Experiment Title]
### Name: Your Name Roll No.: Your Roll Number Date: YYYY-MM-DD
### Aim:
* [Write a brief statement about the purpose of the experiment. For example: "To understand
* and implement the use of for and while loops in shell scripting."]
### Requirements
* [List any software, tools, or pre-requisites needed. For example: "A Linux machine with
* bash shell."]
## Theory
* [Provide a 2-3 line brief theoretical background of the concept being tested. This shows
* you understand the 'why' behind the exercise.]
## $$rocedure & Observations
## Exercise 1: [Task Name]
## Task Statement: [Paste the exact task given in the lab manual here.]
## Explanation: [In your own words, explain the approach you took to solve the task. What command did you use and why?]
## Command(s):

## Output:
<p align="center">

</p>

## Exercise 2: [Task Name]
## Task Statement: [Paste the task given in the lab manual.]
## Explanation: [Explain your approach.]
## Command(s):
```[Paste your command/script here.]```
## Output:
[Paste your output here.]
[Repeat the structure for all exercises.]
## Result
* [State the final outcome of the experiment. For example: "The exercises were successfully
completed. The for and while loops were implemented to iterate through lists and
conditions."]
## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes
* Challenge 1: [Describe any error you encountered and how you fixed it. For
example: "The loop was running infinitely because the condition was incorrect. I
fixed it by updating the variable inside the loop."]
* Challenge 2: [Another challenge, if any.]
## Learning: [What new concept or command did you learn?]
## Conclusion
* [Write a brief summary of what you accomplished in the lab and how it connects to the
course concepts.]
