## Experiment 7: Shell Programming, Process and Scheduling

### Name: Hrithvik Bhardwaj   Roll No.: 590029169   Date: 2025-09-23

### Aim:

* To write shell scripts that demonstrate process management.
* To understand how to schedule processes using `cron` and `at`.
* To monitor running processes and practice job control commands.

### Requirements

* A Linux machine with bash shell.
* Access to process management commands (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`).
* Access to scheduling utilities (`cron`, `at`).

## Theory

Every program running in Linux is a process identified by a unique process ID (PID). Shell programming allows automation of tasks including spawning and controlling processes. Process management commands like `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `jobs`, `bg`, and `fg` let users monitor and control execution. Scheduling utilities such as `cron` (repeated tasks) and `at` (one-time tasks) allow tasks to run automatically at defined times. Combining scripting with scheduling is a core system administration skill.

## Procedure & Observations

## Exercise 1: Writing a basic shell script

### Task Statement:

Create a shell script that prints the current date, time, and the list of logged-in users.

### Command(s):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current date and time: $(date)"
echo "Logged in users:"
w
```

### Output:

![exp7_script](/.img/exp7_script.png)

---

## Exercise 2: Background and foreground processes

### Task Statement:

Run a process in background and bring it to the foreground.

### Command(s):

```bash
sleep 60 &
jobs
fg %1
```

### Output:

![exp7_bg_fg](/.img/exp7_bg_fg.png)

---

## Exercise 3: Killing a process

### Task Statement:

Start a process and terminate it using `kill`.

### Command(s):

```bash
sleep 300 &
ps aux | grep sleep
kill <pid>
```

### Output:

![exp7_kill](/.img/exp7_kill.png)

---

## Exercise 4: Monitoring processes

### Task Statement:

Use `ps` and `top` to monitor processes.

### Command(s):

```bash
ps aux | head -5
top
```

### Output:

![exp7_monitor](/.img/exp7_monitor.png)

---

## Exercise 5: Using `cron` for scheduling

### Task Statement:

Schedule a script to run every day at 7:00 AM using `cron`.

### Command(s):

```bash
crontab -e
0 7 * * * /home/retr0/myscript.sh
```
<!--

## Exercise 6: Using `at` for one-time scheduling

### Task Statement:

Schedule a script to run once at a specified time using `at`.

### Command(s):

```bash
echo "/home/user/myscript.sh" | at 08:30
atq
```
<!--
### Output:

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/exp7_at.png" width="900">
</p>
-->
---

## Result

* Learned to create and run shell scripts.
* Managed processes using background, foreground, and kill commands.
* Monitored processes with `ps` and `top`.
* Scheduled recurring tasks with `cron` and one-time tasks with `at`.

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes

* Challenge 1: Remembering the `crontab` time format. Solved by using online crontab generators and practice.
* Challenge 2: Ensuring `atd` service is running for `at` command. Fixed by starting the service with `systemctl start atd`.

### Learning:

* Gained hands-on knowledge of process creation and termination.
* Learned job control and scheduling using `cron` and `at`.

## Conclusion

This experiment provided practical experience with shell scripting, process management, and scheduling. These are critical skills for system administrators to automate and control Linux environments effectively.
